FREEDOS Ripcord OEM BootDisk
This is a bare boot disk intended for base of other boot disks.
It only contains the minimal necessary to boot DOS, please
add your own particular programs to it (such as a BIOS
update or multiboot loader).  Please also make available
the corresponding source set (source_core.zip), as it
contains all files necessary for license (GPL) compliance.

This disk is not intended for installation of FreeDOS.
USE OF THIS DISK IS AT YOUR OWN RISK

This boot disk is auto generated about once a week.
Some portions (such as the Kernel) are built from latest
source or latest downloadable binary, whereas other portions
are manually updated.  An archive with all source (to satisfy
various license requirements, e.g. GPL) should be available
with the disk/disk image.  You should obtain it at the
same time, as only the latest available boot disk and source
archive are provided.

Please use the FreeDOS lists if you need assistance.
